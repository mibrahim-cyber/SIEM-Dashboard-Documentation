﻿# Known bugs and gaps

This appendix tracks intentional teaching limitations and open gaps in HABIBI-SIEM. Use it when student reports sound like defects but match expected prototype behavior.

## Log ingestion and settings routing

**Symptom:** Sidebar shows Log Ingestion or Settings but navigation lands on a blank shell or wrong module.

**Impact:** Operators cannot reach ingest without using Command Palette or direct route bookmark.

**Workaround:** Open Ingest from command palette if configured, or use the documentation site deep link to Log Ingestion. Refresh after switching major sections.

**Teaching note:** Coursework may grade navigation diagrams even when one route is broken; document the workaround in lab answers.

## Simulated alert flag handling

**Symptom:** Console error or missing badge when Simulate Campaign fires while filters are active.

**Impact:** Campaign still produces alerts but UI may not label them as simulated.

**Workaround:** Clear filters, rerun campaign, reload page once.

## Command palette versus sidebar iDs

**Symptom:** Palette jump goes nowhere or opens wrong module.

**Impact:** Keyboard-first users hit dead ends.

**Workaround:** Use sidebar until IDs are aligned in a future fix. Note failing palette entry in bug reports.

## Rule toggles not persisted

**Symptom:** Disabled rules re-enable after browser refresh.

**Impact:** Shift handoff cannot assume rule state survived.

**Workaround:** Record enabled rule set in shift log. Re-disable noisy rules at start of each lab session.

## IOC watchlist client-only

**Symptom:** Watchlist empty after reload though blocks were added.

**Impact:** Repeat SOAR demos must re-add indicators.

**Workaround:** Treat watchlist as session scratch pad. For pentests, verify server-side deny paths still return 403 even when UI list is empty.

## Detection runs in the browser

**Symptom:** Alerts differ if API is called directly without browser detection pass.

**Impact:** Teaches that client/server split matters; not production-grade enforcement.

**Workaround:** Always demo through normal UI ingest. Discuss server validation as hygiene layer only.

## Memory-backed sessions

**Symptom:** All users logged out after API restart.

**Impact:** Long lab weeks need re-login after server bounce.

**Workaround:** Schedule restarts between classes. Keep session secret stable within a week.
