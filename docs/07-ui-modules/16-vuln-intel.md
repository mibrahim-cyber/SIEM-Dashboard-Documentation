# Vulnerability intel

HABIBI-SIEM exposes this capability under **Intelligence → Vuln Intel**. Vuln intel surfaces sample CVE-style records tied to assets for prioritization discussions in class labs.

## What you see on screen

Cards show CVE id, severity, affected product, and suggested remediation blurb.

## How data moves through the dashboard

Data is seeded for demonstration; edits may not persist across reload depending on build settings.

## Day-to-day operator workflow

Use to practice patch prioritization narratives alongside Risk Scoring. Link asset names to Asset Inventory entries when names align.

## Edge cases and false trails

Do not treat demo CVE text as live scanner output. Empty state means seed data not loaded for the session.

## Links to deeper walkthroughs

Operators who need click-by-click screenshots and field-by-field explanations should start at the module guide index below. Architecture and security topics (sessions, CSRF, RBAC) live in the docs tree and apply across modules.

## Shift handoff checklist

Before ending a lab session, record which account role was active, whether deduplication was on, and the last ingest batch size. Screenshot Overview KPIs if coursework requires evidence. If students report empty views, ask whether they refreshed after Simulate Campaign and whether filters hide new alerts. When promoting from tier1 to tier2 accounts, log out fully so cookies do not blend roles.

## Coordination with other modules

Cross-link findings in Case Manager or Incident views when drills span multiple screens. Threat Intel and Geo Map should tell the same story about an IP before watchlist blocking. Pipeline Health confirms whether zeros are detection silence or ingest failure. For security sign-off, pair this topic with CSRF and RBAC docs before external exposure.
