# Login

HABIBI-SIEM exposes this capability under **Auth gate**. Login establishes session cookie and CSRF token required for all mutating API calls afterward.

## What you see on screen

Username and password form; error banner on failure; redirect into Overview on success.

## How data moves through the dashboard

Server validates credentials, sets HTTP-only session, returns CSRF token JSON for client storage. Subsequent writes send header token.

## Day-to-day operator workflow

Use tier-appropriate accounts in RBAC labs. Log out between role tests to avoid cookie confusion.

## Edge cases and false trails

Default teaching passwords must be rotated for any internet-exposed host. Missing CSRF after login causes mysterious 403 on first save.

## Shift handoff checklist

Before ending a lab session, record which account role was active, whether deduplication was on, and the last ingest batch size. Screenshot Overview KPIs if coursework requires evidence. If students report empty views, ask whether they refreshed after Simulate Campaign and whether filters hide new alerts. When promoting from tier1 to tier2 accounts, log out fully so cookies do not blend roles.

## Coordination with other modules

Cross-link findings in Case Manager or Incident views when drills span multiple screens. Threat Intel and Geo Map should tell the same story about an IP before watchlist blocking. Pipeline Health confirms whether zeros are detection silence or ingest failure. For security sign-off, pair this topic with CSRF and RBAC docs before external exposure.
