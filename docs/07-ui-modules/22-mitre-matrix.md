# MITRE ATT&CK matrix

HABIBI-SIEM exposes this capability under **Configure → MITRE Matrix**. Matrix maps enabled detection rules to ATT&CK techniques for coverage conversations.

## What you see on screen

Heat-coloured cells by tactic column; hover shows technique names tied to rules that fired or are available.

## How data moves through the dashboard

Mapping comes from rule metadata bundled with detection definitions. Hits increase emphasis on cells linked to active rules.

## Day-to-day operator workflow

Use in executive briefings to show detection gaps when entire columns stay pale. Enable more rules before claiming full coverage.

## Edge cases and false trails

Matrix shows rule intent, not live attacker technique confirmation. Disabled rules still appear as available but not firing.

## Links to deeper walkthroughs

Operators who need click-by-click screenshots and field-by-field explanations should start at the module guide index below. Architecture and security topics (sessions, CSRF, RBAC) live in the docs tree and apply across modules.

## Shift handoff checklist

Before ending a lab session, record which account role was active, whether deduplication was on, and the last ingest batch size. Screenshot Overview KPIs if coursework requires evidence. If students report empty views, ask whether they refreshed after Simulate Campaign and whether filters hide new alerts. When promoting from tier1 to tier2 accounts, log out fully so cookies do not blend roles.

## Coordination with other modules

Cross-link findings in Case Manager or Incident views when drills span multiple screens. Threat Intel and Geo Map should tell the same story about an IP before watchlist blocking. Pipeline Health confirms whether zeros are detection silence or ingest failure. For security sign-off, pair this topic with CSRF and RBAC docs before external exposure.
