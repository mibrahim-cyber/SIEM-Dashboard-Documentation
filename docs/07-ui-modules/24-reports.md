# Reports

HABIBI-SIEM exposes this capability under **Reporting → Reports**. Reports generates exportable summaries of alert statistics and module highlights for coursework deliverables.

## What you see on screen

Pick template, time window, and format (PDF or CSV where available). Preview before download.

## How data moves through the dashboard

Report data snapshots current client statistics; scheduled runs may be described in Scheduler module.

## Day-to-day operator workflow

Export after Simulate Campaign for rich charts. Name files with date and scenario for grading clarity.

## Edge cases and false trails

Large exports with zero alerts produce empty shells; ingest first. Browser pop-up blockers can stop downloads silently.

## Links to deeper walkthroughs

Operators who need click-by-click screenshots and field-by-field explanations should start at the module guide index below. Architecture and security topics (sessions, CSRF, RBAC) live in the docs tree and apply across modules.

## Shift handoff checklist

Before ending a lab session, record which account role was active, whether deduplication was on, and the last ingest batch size. Screenshot Overview KPIs if coursework requires evidence. If students report empty views, ask whether they refreshed after Simulate Campaign and whether filters hide new alerts. When promoting from tier1 to tier2 accounts, log out fully so cookies do not blend roles.

## Coordination with other modules

Cross-link findings in Case Manager or Incident views when drills span multiple screens. Threat Intel and Geo Map should tell the same story about an IP before watchlist blocking. Pipeline Health confirms whether zeros are detection silence or ingest failure. For security sign-off, pair this topic with CSRF and RBAC docs before external exposure.
