# Props and state patterns

HABIBI-SIEM UI modules share implementation patterns documented here for coursework extensions.

## Purpose

Shared UI modules rely on props for presentation and local state for ephemeral filters. Long-lived security data (alerts, incidents, rules) lives in the central SIEM context provider so sibling views stay synchronized without prop drilling across the entire tree.

## Runtime behavior

When a child view updates alert status, it calls context mutators that optimistically adjust UI then confirm with API responses. Failed writes roll back or show error toasts depending on module.

## Operator and developer notes

Document which fields are controlled vs uncontrolled when writing custom coursework extensions. Misplaced state causes Overview and Alert Manager to disagree until refresh.

## Shift handoff checklist

Before ending a lab session, record which account role was active, whether deduplication was on, and the last ingest batch size. Screenshot Overview KPIs if coursework requires evidence. If students report empty views, ask whether they refreshed after Simulate Campaign and whether filters hide new alerts. When promoting from tier1 to tier2 accounts, log out fully so cookies do not blend roles.

## Coordination with other modules

Cross-link findings in Case Manager or Incident views when drills span multiple screens. Threat Intel and Geo Map should tell the same story about an IP before watchlist blocking. Pipeline Health confirms whether zeros are detection silence or ingest failure. For security sign-off, pair this topic with CSRF and RBAC docs before external exposure.
