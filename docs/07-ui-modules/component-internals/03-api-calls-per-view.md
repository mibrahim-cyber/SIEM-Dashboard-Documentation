# API calls per view

HABIBI-SIEM UI modules share implementation patterns documented here for coursework extensions.

## Purpose

Read-heavy views hit GET endpoints for alerts, incidents, audit (admin), and health. Writes batch status changes, watchlist operations, and SOAR log entries with CSRF headers.

## Runtime behavior

Threat and geo endpoints are server-proxied to hide third-party keys. Rate limits may return 429 on repeated threat lookups during student pile-ons.

## Operator and developer notes

Map each button in lab worksheets to HTTP method and expected status for tier1 vs tier2. Teaches that UI labels are not authorization.

## Shift handoff checklist

Before ending a lab session, record which account role was active, whether deduplication was on, and the last ingest batch size. Screenshot Overview KPIs if coursework requires evidence. If students report empty views, ask whether they refreshed after Simulate Campaign and whether filters hide new alerts. When promoting from tier1 to tier2 accounts, log out fully so cookies do not blend roles.

## Coordination with other modules

Cross-link findings in Case Manager or Incident views when drills span multiple screens. Threat Intel and Geo Map should tell the same story about an IP before watchlist blocking. Pipeline Health confirms whether zeros are detection silence or ingest failure. For security sign-off, pair this topic with CSRF and RBAC docs before external exposure.
